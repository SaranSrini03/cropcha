## 📦 How It Works

1. **Farmer registers crop batch** on CropChain → Blockchain records batch ID and details.  
2. **Distributor updates batch movement** → Blockchain logs pickup, transport, and delivery.  
3. **Retailer receives batch and sells** → Blockchain logs sale; smart contract triggers payment to farmer.  
4. **Consumer scans QR code** → Verifies origin and supply chain history.  

All data is **immutable, transparent, and traceable**, ensuring trust among all participants.
